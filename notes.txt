Django 

Build and deploy a web application representing Dogs and Cats. 

Each dog and cat must have a name and birthday, and be linked to an Owner.
Owners should be able to access dogs and cats via an API and carry out CRUD operations on their Dog and Cat.
Owners should also be able to access dogs and cats via an admin interface.

Share your work with the interviewer:

Push the source code to a public repository on GitHub or Bitbucket. Send the link to the repository to the reviewer.
Host your app somewhere online. Send the link and admin credentials to the reviewer.
